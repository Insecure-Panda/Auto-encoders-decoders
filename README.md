# Auto-encoders-decoders
Using auto encoders and decoders to build a machine learning model that denoises noisy images. 
This notebook was a submission for a kaggle competition hosted by Army Institute of Technology and Deep Info Labs called AITxDIL. 
The data for the notebook can be found at the competition link "https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/aitxdil-project-jupyter/". 
The model uses auto encoders and image augmentation to denoise the images.
